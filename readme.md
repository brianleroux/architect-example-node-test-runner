A quick experiment using the new built-in Node.js test runner to make a small client CRUDL library for DynamoDB.

Try it out! Clone this repo, installing dependencies with `npm i` and running `npm t`.

- `app.arc` defines a DynamoDB (DDB) table called 'accounts'
- `index.mjs` exports a basic CRUDL client for DDB table above
- `test.mjs` defines a test suite for the client
- `package.json` sets up `npm t` and deps
